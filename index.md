# Regression Analysis on Predicting Car Price
## Introduction
To complete our training at Talent Path, We must present a capstone project to demonstrate our skills and knowledge that we have been learning for the past few weeks. I have done an indepth analysis on a dataset and created a model that can predict car price at 92% accuracy. My goal for this project is to incorporate the prexisting knowledge that I have of cars and working at a dealership along with my knowledge and skills that I have learning throughout my training.

## Objective
My Objective is to create a set of models with the dataset I cleaned to achieve an accuracy score above 70% with a low RMSE Score. I will then select a model and incorporate it into a small full stack aplication.
