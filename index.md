# Regression Analysis on Predicting Car Price
## Introduction
To complete our training at Talent Path, We must present a capstone project to demonstrate our skills and knowledge that we have been learning for the past few weeks. I have done an indepth analysis on a dataset and created a model that can predict car price at 92% accuracy. My goal for this project is to incorporate the prexisting knowledge that I have of cars and working at a dealership along with my knowledge and skills that I have learning throughout my training.

## Objective
My Objective is to create a set of models with the dataset I cleaned to achieve an accuracy score above 70% with a low RMSE Score. I will then select a model and incorporate it into a small full stack aplication.

## Business Value
With this model a dealership or any user may use this to predict current market value of vehicles that may come in as trade ins or can be potentially be bought from an auto auction. By being able to predict the market value of the car the user can make an informed decision to purchase a vehicle at a good value or for a dealership to make a purchase of a vehicle knowing exactly the potential marginal profit it can make.

## Data
I obtained my dataset from kaggle called "US Used cars dataset". This dataset was created from a web scrapper in the month of September in 2020. This dataset contains 3 Million rows of data with 66 features that pertained to the car and the dealership information.
## Data Processing
### Remove Features
I decided to start my Data Processing by removing any features that we can simply remove that wont affect our target values and that arent relevant to our situation.
### Remove Outliers
### Remove Under Represented Values
### Replacing values
### Impute
